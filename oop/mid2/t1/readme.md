ListConverter - 2n-1 Algorithm Implementation
Overview
ListConverter is a Java application that implements a specialized algorithm combining the 2n-1 mathematical formula with a systematic element removal process. The program processes two lists: a list of integers and a list of strings, applying complex logic to produce a final filtered result.

Features

2n-1 Formula Processing: Uses integers from the first list as 'n' values to calculate indices using the formula 2n-1
Dynamic String Selection: Selects strings from the second list based on calculated indices
Systematic Removal Algorithm: Implements a removal process that eliminates elements at increasing indices (0, 1, 2, ...) with index renewal after each removal
Bounds Checking: Handles out-of-bounds indices gracefully
Comprehensive Logging: Provides detailed output for each step of the process

Algorithm Description
Phase 1: 2n-1 Index Calculation

Takes each integer 'n' from list1
Calculates index using formula: index = 2 * n - 1
If the calculated index is valid (within bounds of list2), selects the string at that position
Builds a result list with selected strings

Phase 2: Systematic Removal Process

Starts with the result list from Phase 1
Removes elements at increasing indices: 0, then 1, then 2, and so on
After each removal, list indexes are automatically renewed
Continues until exactly 5 elements remain in the list
If removal index exceeds list size, resets to index 0

Sample Data
Input Lists
javaList<Integer> list1 = [5, 8, 8, 5, 4, 9, 4, 2, 7, 5, 9, 4, 2]

Processing Examples

n=8: index = 2Ã—8-1 = 15 â†’ selects list2[15] = "FUGu"
n=4: index = 2Ã—4-1 = 7 â†’ selects list2[7] = "h1d"
n=9: index = 2Ã—9-1 = 17 â†’ selects list2[17] = "8w6"

Processing using 2n-1 formula:
=================================
n=5 -> index=9 -> "u1J6T"
n=8 -> index=15 -> "FUGu"
n=8 -> index=15 -> "FUGu"
n=5 -> index=9 -> "u1J6T"
n=4 -> index=7 -> "h1d"
n=9 -> index=17 -> "8w6"
n=4 -> index=7 -> "h1d"
n=2 -> index=3 -> "rbK1H"
n=7 -> index=13 -> "9cQj"
n=5 -> index=9 -> "u1J6T"
n=9 -> index=17 -> "8w6"
n=4 -> index=7 -> "h1d"
n=2 -> index=3 -> "rbK1H"
Phase 2 Output
Starting removal process:
Initial list: [u1J6T, FUGu, FUGu, u1J6T, h1d, 8w6, h1d, rbK1H, 9cQj, u1J6T, 8w6, h1d, rbK1H] (size: 13)
Removed element at index 0: "u1J6T"
List after removal: [FUGu, FUGu, u1J6T, h1d, 8w6, h1d, rbK1H, 9cQj, u1J6T, 8w6, h1d, rbK1H] (size: 12)
Removed element at index 1: "FUGu"
List after removal: [FUGu, u1J6T, h1d, 8w6, h1d, rbK1H, 9cQj, u1J6T, 8w6, h1d, rbK1H] (size: 11)
...
[Process continues until 5 elements remain]
Technical Details
Time Complexity

Phase 1: O(n) where n is the size of list1
Phase 2: O(mÂ²) where m is the size of the intermediate result list
Overall: O(n + mÂ²)

Space Complexity

Additional Space: O(m) for storing intermediate and final results
In-place Operations: Removal process modifies the working list dynamically

Error Handling

Index Bounds: Validates calculated indices against list2 boundaries
Empty Lists: Handles edge cases with empty input lists
Invalid Inputs: Gracefully manages out-of-bounds scenarios
